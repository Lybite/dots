# dots (WIP)
Current Setup:
- Distro: Fedora 33
- WM: bswpm
- Terminal Emulator: Alacritty
- Color scheme: Gruvbox

This repo holds most of my configuration files for the various programs I use, such as my window manager, terminal emulator, music player, etc. Not everything is fully up on the repo as I'm still testing to see what works and what I like. It's mostly for myself and my mediocrity,but if you find anything useful go ahead and take it.


# Packages to install
Not all packages are included yet.

Fedora:
<pre><code>sudo dnf install bspwm sxhkd polybar mpd alacritty</code></pre>
Make sure to enable the non free repositories to install discord and spotify.

Arch Linux:
<pre><code>yay -S bspwm sxhkd polybar mpd alacritty discord spotify</code></pre>
I use an AUR helper called `yay`. I highly reccomend it.
